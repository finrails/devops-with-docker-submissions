The docker-compose.yml that you'll find here, is just a copy of the 2.8 one,
that's because i already did the things work. Here are the steps that i took
to make the buttons works properly:

1. I did set the env frontend variable REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to port :80 in localhost
	> thats because now the requests are made by the reverse proxy, and the reverse proxy
	> will make request as the origin localhost:80 and not as localhost:8080.
	> why? well, the frontend (::5000) will make a request to ::80/api, the reverse proxy
	> will identify this '/api' endpoint (thanks to the nginx.conf) and will make a request 
	> to this 'api' endpoint then, we will also need to set this '/api' endpoint to receive 
	> requests on "::80" and we did it, we set the "REQUEST_ORIGIN" in the backend as "::80"
	> so the backend will response with some "pong" and the reverse proxy ::80 will just
	> return it to the front, and the front will process this data; after that the front will
	> return the html page to the ::80 (reverse proxy) which will return it to the client (browser).

that's all, i'll put this into the readme, i'm just tired to write some .md file now.
