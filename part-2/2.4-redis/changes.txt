The only thing i did beyond add the redis into the docker compose
was just set up the REDIS_HOST in the back Dockerfile.

The base backend image is already well configured for redis, so
you do not really need to set ports or something like that. Just
set the env putting the redis service name in it.

The DNS resolver will do all the hard work.

You also need to set it up, if you want that it works in your machine.
