Well, i really like to develop backend system, while i do that in the past
i've used Docker so many times. I don't know, it was so easy to put the
application up. Set the database, cache, workers, queues. So nice.

It was like i had the control of everything in the system, and it is
a really good sensation.

And if some day i wish to develop the project with some people else,
i just need to upload the docker images to the hub, and the docker-compose
to the github.

Really useful.

Oh there's the version control as well; i didn't need any runtime manager
(like asdf), because docker does that role very well.
